I made this aplication based SheldonNeilson's Android-Alarm-Clock open Project.
But, it's not work well over android 5.0 Lolipop version.
So i modifty simplely and now work well.

This project's main function is AR based alarm.
I use Kudan SDK Free License.

so, If you want to use this project, you should put this project's license key in Project's ApiSingletone Class and modifying the package's name like this. -> com.ngost.easyjin ->> eu.kudan.ar

Thank you. Another questions -> hm5207@gmail.com or visit https://ngost.tistory.com
